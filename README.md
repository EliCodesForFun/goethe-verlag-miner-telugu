# goethe-verlag-miner-telugu
Made this audio miner for the site goethe-verlag.com


This is an audio miner script written in Python using BeautifulSoup, pandas and requests libraries. 
It scrapes a German language learning website to get mp3 links and corresponding English and Telagu translations. 
It then downloads the mp3 files and renames them as "English Translation - Telagu Translation.mp3". 

I post-fixed the filenames after realizing the Telugu formatting included the romanization as well.


Here is the website:

This code can be repurposed for other languages as well.
